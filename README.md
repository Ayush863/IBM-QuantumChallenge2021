# IBM-QuantumChallenge2021
4 Solved Exercises.
Couldn't solve exercise 5 at the time so it's still unsolved. The challenge is over and the official solutions are available at IBM Quantum's Github page.

Ex: 1 Implementation of the Toffoli gate using the basis gates for IBM Quantum systems i.e., CX, RZ, SX and X gates.

Ex: 2 **Shor's Algorithm.** Created a circuit that carries out the quantum part of Shor’s algorithm. Finally factorising 35 using the algorithm.

Ex: 3 **Quantum error correction.** Create circuits which can detect x and z errors on two qubits

Ex: 4 **Transmon qubit.** Finding  transition frequency ** |1> --> |2> using the calibrated X-180 pulse and spectroscopy (sweeping frequency).

Ex: 5 $⟨a|b⟩$
